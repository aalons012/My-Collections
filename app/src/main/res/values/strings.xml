    <string name="gamecube_text">No One can ever forget their first Console and man i am so happy that i actually grew up with a console like this. This has been special to me so much that i dont think i would be the same person as i am today if i didnt grew up with the Gamecube today because my first 2 games that i played made me the way who i am today. This was bought as welcoming gift from moving from new york to miami at the age of 4. This is where it all started</string>
